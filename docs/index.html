        <p><strong>Hello, I'm Ravern.</strong></h1>
        <p>I'm a software engineer based in Singapore.</p>
        <p>
          I'm interested in programming languages, databases and distributed
          systems. I believe that the Internet today leaves much to be desired,
          so I strive to direct my interests towards building a better one for
          tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently a student at the
          <a href="https://nus.edu.sg">National University of Singapore</a>
          majoring in Computer Science. I'm also helping to organise events at
          <a href="https://nushackers.org">NUS Hackers</a> as a coreteam member.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I'm doing an internship at
          <a href="https://optiver.com">Optiver</a>. Last summer, I did an
          internship at
          <a href="https://open.gov.sg">Open Government Products</a> in
          Singapore, where I helped build a better way for the Singapore
          government to collect payments.
