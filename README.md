# Hello! I'm Ravern.

I'm a software engineer based in Singapore.

I'm interested in programming languages, databases and distributed systems. I believe that the Internet today leaves much to be desired, so I strive to direct my interests towards building a better one for tomorrow.

I’m currently a student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) majoring in Computer Science. I'm also helping to organise events at [NUS Hackers](https://nushackers.org) as a coreteam member.

This summer, I'm doing an internship at [Optiver](https://optiver.com). Last summer, I did an internship at [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg) in Singapore, where I helped build a better way for the Singapore government to collect payments.
