**Hello! I'm Ravern, a software engineer based in Singapore.**

I'm interested in programming languages, distributed systems and networks. I believe that the Internet today leaves much to be desired, so I strive to direct my interests towards building a better one for tomorrow.

I’m currently a Computer Science major at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg).

Before that, I spent close to a year as a software engineer at [Taskade](https://taskade.com/), where I led the development of their browser extension and fleshed out real-time collaboration on their platform.

Let’s chat over [email](mailto:ravernkoh@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ravernkoh)!
