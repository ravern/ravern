# Hello! I'm Ravern.

I'm a software engineer based in Singapore.

I'm interested in programming languages, distributed systems and networks. I believe that the Internet today leaves much to be desired, so I strive to direct my interests towards building a better one for tomorrow.

Iâ€™m currently a student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) majoring in Computer Science. I'm also helping to organise events at [NUS Hackers](https://nushackers.org) as a coreteam member.

This summer, I'm did an internship at [Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg) in Singapore, where I helped build a better way for the Singapore government to collect payments. Before that, I spent close to a year as a software engineer at [Taskade](https://taskade.com/), where I led the development of their browser extension and fleshed out real-time collaboration on their platform.
