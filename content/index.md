**Hello, I'm Ravern.**

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg), interested in compilers, web technology and conflict-free replicated data types.

I'm currently

* organising events at [NUS Hackers](https://nushackers.org)
* writing on [this blog](/writing)
* building [a simple scripting language](https://github.com/ravern/doji)

I'm always happy to chat about topics related or adjacent to my interests. You can reach me through [email](mailto:ravernkoh@gmail.com) or [Telegram](https://t.me/ravernkoh).
