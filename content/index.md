<h1 id="greeting">Hello, I'm Ravern.</h1>

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg), interested in building compilers and [local-first software](https://localfirstweb.dev/).

I'm currently

* organising events at [NUS Hackers](https://nushackers.org)
* building a [scripting language](https://github.com/ravern/doji) in Rust
* writing about [what I find interesting](/writing)

I'm always happy to chat about topics related or adjacent to my interests. You can reach me through [email](mailto:ravernkoh@gmail.com) or [Telegram](https://t.me/ravernkoh).
